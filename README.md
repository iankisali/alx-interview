# Alx Technical Interview Questions

This is a repo contains directories of projects on technical interview questions carried out during Software Engineering studies at `ALX-Africa SE` .

In the projects in this repo, I'm solving technical interview problems as a important skill landing a job in SWE.

## Projects

All of the following directories are projects done during the studies:
| Project name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
[`0x00-pascal_triangle`](https://github.com/iankisali/alx-interview/tree/main/0x00-pascal_triangle) | Function that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of `n`. |
[`0x01-lockboxes`](https://github.com/iankisali/alx-interview/tree/main/0x01-lockboxes) | Method that determines if all the boxes can be opened if each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.. |
[`0x02-minimum_operations`](https://github.com/iankisali/alx-interview/tree/main/0x02-minimum_operations) | Method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n H` characters in a file given in the text file, there is a single character `H`. Text editor can execute only two operations in this file: `Copy All` and `Paste`. Given a number `n`. |
